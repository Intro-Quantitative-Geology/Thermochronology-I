# Thermochronology-I
In the exercises for the final two weeks of the course we will combine several of the equations we have seen with some basic geostatistics to link low-temperature thermochronometer ages from Bhutan to their long-term average rates of rock exhumation. For the first week we will start by exploring the time-dependent heat advection-conduction equation in 1D and linking that to a code for calculating the closure temperature for different thermochronometers.
